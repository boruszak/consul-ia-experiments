# Connect services with Consul on virtual machines (VMs)

This page describes the process to deploy sidecar proxies on VMs so that your services can connect to Consul's service mesh.

## Workflow

For each service you want to connect to the service mesh, complete the following steps:

1. Configure global proxy settings. Configure global passthrough settings for all proxies deployed to your service mesh in the [proxy defaults configuration entry](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/proxy-defaults).
1. Deploy your service mesh proxy. [Configure proxy behavior in a service definition](/consul/docs/reference/service) to register the proxy with Consul.
1. Start the proxy service. Proxies appear in the list of services registered to Consul and you must start them before they can route traffic in your service mesh.
1. Restart services to listen on `localhost` so that they no longer accept traffic from any source but the Envoy proxy.

For additional guidance, refer to the [Securely connect your services with Consul service mesh tutorial](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms/virtual-machine-gs-service-mesh). This tutorial includes scripts that automate configuration steps in order to demonstrate the practical workflows involved to start each proxy for each service.

## Next steps

After you start the sidecar proxies, the rest of Consul's service mesh features are available. You can now use Consul to [manage traffic between services](/consul/docs/manage-traffic) and [observe service mesh telemetry](/consul/docs/observe/vm).

Your current service mesh is not ready for production environments. To secure north/south access from external sources into the service mesh, [Deploy the Consul API gateway](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway). Then, you must secure service-to-service communication with mTLS certificates and service intentions. Refer to [secure the service mesh](/consul/docs/secure) for more information.
