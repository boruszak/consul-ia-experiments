# Consul 1.21.0

We are pleased to announce the following Consul updates.

## Release highlights

- **Documentation improvements**: Consul v1.21 includes significant updates to the structure and content of the documentation. Highlights include a dedicated sequence on "Consul fundamentals" for new learners, the division of usage documentation into _Consul operations_ and _service networking_, and a conceptual re-alignment around the principles of _north/south_ and _east/west_ networking operations. For a detailed explanation of the documentation's new design, refer to the [Consul information architecture and content strategy README on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/tree/main/website/content). Previous versions will retain the documentation that accompanied their release. To find documentation for an earlier release, use the dropdown on developer.hashicorp.com to select a specific version.

- **Long term support (LTS)**: For Enterprise users, Consul v1.21 is an LTS release. These versions of Consul receive support for two years after their release, allowing for less frequent system upgrades and continued support through patches and fixes. For more information about this program, refer to [Long term support](/consul/docs/upgrade/lts).

- **OpenShift 4.16 support**: Consul v1.21 includes improvements to support RedHat OpenShift clusters running [OpenShift Container Platform version 4.16](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16). To get started with Consul on OpenShift clusters, refer to [Consul on RedHat OpenShift](/consul/docs/openshift).
