# Advertise address parameters for Consul agent configuration files

The page provides reference information for address advertisement parameters in a Consul agent configuration file.

## Advertise Address Parameters

- `advertise_addr` Equivalent to the [`-advertise` command-line flag](/consul/commands/agent#_advertise).

- `advertise_addr_ipv4` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_ipv6`](#advertise_addr_ipv6) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_ipv6` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_ipv4`](#advertise_addr_ipv4) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_wan` Equivalent to the [`-advertise-wan` command-line flag](/consul/commands/agent#_advertise-wan).

- `advertise_addr_wan_ipv4` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_wan_ipv6`](#advertise_addr_wan_ipv6) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_addr_wan_ipv6` This was added together with [`advertise_addr_wan_ipv4`](#advertise_addr_wan_ipv4) to support dual stack IPv4/IPv6 environments. Using this, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be specified and requested during eg service discovery.

- `advertise_reconnect_timeout` This is a per-agent setting of the [`reconnect_timeout`](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file/general#reconnect_timeout) parameter.
  This agent will advertise to all other nodes in the cluster that after this timeout, the node may be completely
  removed from the cluster. This may only be set on client agents and if unset then other nodes will use the main
  `reconnect_timeout` setting when determining when this node may be removed
  from the cluster.
