# Encryption parameters for Consul agent configuration files

The page provides reference information for DNS parameters in a Consul agent configuration file.

## Encryption Parameters

- `auto_config` This object allows setting options for the `auto_config` feature.

  The following sub-keys are available:

  - `enabled` (Defaults to `false`) This option enables `auto_config` on a client
    agent. When starting up but before joining the cluster, the client agent will
    make an RPC to the configured server addresses to request configuration settings,
    such as its `agent` ACL token, TLS certificates, Gossip encryption key as well
    as other configuration settings. These configurations get merged in as defaults
    with any user-supplied configuration on the client agent able to override them.
    The initial RPC uses a JWT specified with either `intro_token`,
    `intro_token_file` or the `CONSUL_INTRO_TOKEN` environment variable to authorize
    the request. How the JWT token is verified is controlled by the `auto_config.authorizer`
    object available for use on Consul servers. Enabling this option also enables
    service mesh because it is vital for `auto_config`, more specifically the service mesh CA
    and certificates infrastructure.

    ~> **Warning:** Enabling `auto_config` conflicts with the [`auto_encrypt.tls`](#tls) feature.
    Only one option may be specified.

- `auto_encrypt` This object allows setting options for the `auto_encrypt` feature.

  The following sub-keys are available:

  - `allow_tls` (Defaults to `false`) This option enables
    `auto_encrypt` on the servers and allows them to automatically distribute certificates
    from the service mesh CA to the clients. If enabled, the server can accept incoming
    connections from both the built-in CA and the service mesh CA, as well as their certificates.
    Note, the server will only present the built-in CA and certificate, which the
    client can verify using the CA it received from `auto_encrypt` endpoint. If disabled,
    a client configured with `auto_encrypt.tls` will be unable to start.

  - `tls` (Defaults to `false`) Allows the client to request the
    service mesh CA and certificates from the servers, for encrypting RPC communication.
    The client will make the request to any servers listed in the `-retry-join`
    option. This requires that every server to have `auto_encrypt.allow_tls` enabled.
    When both `auto_encrypt` options are used, it allows clients to receive certificates
    that are generated on the servers. If the `-server-port` is not the default one,
    it has to be provided to the client as well. Usually this is discovered through
    LAN gossip, but `auto_encrypt` provision happens before the information can be
    distributed through gossip. The most secure `auto_encrypt` setup is when the
    client is provided with the built-in CA, `verify_server_hostname` is turned on,
    and when an ACL token with `node.write` permissions is setup. It is also possible
    to use `auto_encrypt` with a CA and ACL, but without `verify_server_hostname`,
    or only with a ACL enabled, or only with CA and `verify_server_hostname`, or
    only with a CA, or finally without a CA and without ACL enabled. In any case,
    the communication to the `auto_encrypt` endpoint is always TLS encrypted.

    ~> **Warning:** Enabling `auto_encrypt.tls` conflicts with the [`auto_config`](#auto_config) feature.
    Only one option may be specified.

  - `dns_san` (Defaults to `[]`) When this option is being
    used, the certificates requested by `auto_encrypt` from the server have these
    `dns_san` set as DNS SAN.

  - `ip_san` (Defaults to `[]`) When this option is being used,
    the certificates requested by `auto_encrypt` from the server have these `ip_san`
    set as IP SAN.

- `encrypt` Equivalent to the [`-encrypt` command-line flag](/consul/commands/agent#_encrypt).

- `encrypt_verify_incoming` - This is an optional
  parameter that can be used to disable enforcing encryption for incoming gossip
  in order to upshift from unencrypted to encrypted gossip on a running cluster.
  See [this section](/consul/docs/security/encryption#configuring-gossip-encryption-on-an-existing-cluster)
  for more information. Defaults to true.

- `encrypt_verify_outgoing` - This is an optional
  parameter that can be used to disable enforcing encryption for outgoing gossip
  in order to upshift from unencrypted to encrypted gossip on a running cluster.
  See [this section](/consul/docs/security/encryption#configuring-gossip-encryption-on-an-existing-cluster)
  for more information. Defaults to true.
