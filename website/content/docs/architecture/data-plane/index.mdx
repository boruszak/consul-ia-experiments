# Consul data plane architecture

This topic describes Consul's architecture and operations in an application's data plane. Consul can deploy gateways and sidecar proxies to help you secure, observe, and manage application traffic.

For information about the lightweight workload agents Consul uses for container-based applications on Kubernetes and AWS ECS, refer to [Consul data plane](/consul/docs/architecture/control-plane/dataplane).

## Introduction

Consul provides control plane features that help you manage your application's data plane, but it does not run directly in the data plane.

When using Consul for service discovery, no additional components or configurations are required for the data plane.

When using Consul's service mesh features, you can use Consul to create gateways and proxies for service-to-service traffic and to secure user interactions with services.

## Gateways

Gateways secure application traffic between services. There are four kinds of gateways:

- API gateway
- Ingress gateway
- Terminating gateways
- Mesh gateways

## Sidecar proxies

Consul can depoy sidecar proxies so that you can oberve and monitor application traffic.
