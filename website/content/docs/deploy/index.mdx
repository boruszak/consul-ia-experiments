# Deploy Consul overview

This topic provides an overview of the configurations and processes to deploy a Consul agent in your network. 

A node must run Consul to connect to a Consul datacenter. It can run either as a server agent, or as a client agent or Consul dataplane that supports an application workload.

## Consul editions

You can configure agents to run a specific edition of Consul.

| Edition              | How to enable                                         |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Community edition    | Enabled by default.                                   |
| Enterprise           | Configure `license` block in the agent configuration. |
| FIPS 140-2 compliant | Specify an alternate source binary or image.          |

To find the package for a specific release, refer to [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com). To learn more about the differences in Consul editions and their available features, refer to [Consul edition fundamentals](/consul/docs/fundamentals/editions).
