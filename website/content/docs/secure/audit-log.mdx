# Audit logs

This topic describes configuration and usage for audit logs, ehich capture records of all Consul events. With 
audit logs, the audit team can inspect event data to learn which credentials 
have been used, what actions have taken place, and the timestamps associated 
with all of these transactions. This provides provides greater insight and 
accountability for security teams that might be concerned with automating 
service networking tasks.

In this tutorial, you will enable audit logging by providing Consul with a 
configuration file, generate audit log entries, then explore the generated logs 
to understand the contents.

## Prerequisites

To execute the example commands in this tutorial, you will need a Consul 1.8+
Enterprise datacenter with [ACLs enabled](/consul/tutorials/security/access-control-setup-production). 
If you do not have an existing datacenter, you can use a single 
[local agent](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms/virtual-machine-gs-deploy)
with the [Consul Enterprise binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.9.4+ent/).

You will also need an ACL token with `operator=write` and `acl=write` privileges
or you can use a token with the [built-in global management policy](/consul/docs/security/acl#builtin-policies).

## Enable audit logging

To enable audit logging, you will need to create a configuration file in the 
configuration directory on each of your Consul agents.

Create a file with the audit logging configuration in your configuration 
directory.

<CodeTabs>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="audit-logging.hcl">

```hcl
  audit {
    enabled = true
    sink "My sink" {
      type   = "file"
      format = "json"
      path   = "/opt/consul/data/audit/audit.json"
      delivery_guarantee = "best-effort"
      rotate_duration = "24h"
      rotate_max_files = 15
      rotate_bytes = 25165824
    }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="audit-logging.json">

```json
{
	"audit": {
		"enabled": true,
		"sink": {
			"My sink": {
				"type": "file",
				"format": "json",
				"path": "/opt/consul/data/audit/audit.json",
				"delivery_guarantee": "best-effort",
				"rotate_duration": "24h",
				"rotate_max_files": 15,
				"rotate_bytes": 25165824
			}
		}
	}
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</CodeTabs>

Each audit log configuration file uses the following customizable options:

- `enabled` - Controls whether Consul logs each time a user performs an operation.
  ACLs must be enabled to use this feature. Defaults to `false`.

- `path`- The directory and filename to write audit events to.

- `rotate_duration` - Specifies the interval by which the system rotates to a new log file.

- `rotate_max_files` - Defines the limit that Consul should follow before it deletes old log files.

- `rotate_bytes` - Specifies how large an individual log file can grow before Consul rotates to a new file.

Restart each of your agents to load the new configuration. Take special care to 
restart your servers one at a time, restarting the leader last. Ensure each 
server has joined and is operating correctly before restarting the next.

You will need to complete this process on _every_ agent, servers and clients, in 
your datacenter.

To learn more about specific configuration options, check the 
[Consul audit logging documentation](/consul/docs/agent/config/config-files#audit).

## Generate audit logs

Audit logs will appear on the agent where the Consul commands are executed.

Connect to a Consul node and set your ACL token as the `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` 
environment variable for your terminal session. 

```shell-session
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=[YOUR_ACL_TOKEN]
```

To generate an entry, run the `consul members` command.

```shell-session
$ consul members
```

## Explore audit logs

Consul audit logs contain all operational events including which credentials 
have been used, what actions have taken place, and the timestamps associated 
with all of these transactions.

Change directory to the `path` location specified in your configuration file.

```shell-session
$ cd /opt/consul/data/audit/
```

Use `tail` to read the latest contents of your audit log file.

```shell-session
$ tail audit-1616781015875224800.json
```

Below is an example records generated as a result of running the `consul members` 
command on a server in the cluster with the ACL's initial management token set.

Each Consul audit log contains the following data:

- `created_at` - The timestamp value of when the event log was created.

- `type` - The type of event.

- `timestamp` - The timestamp value of when the event occurred.

- `auth` - ACL authentication identity.

- `request` - Detailed information about the event including the source host, 
destination host, and additional content relevant to the type of request.

- `response` - The HTTP response status of the request.

<Note title="Best Practice">

 Due to the amount of logs generated and their distributed 
nature, it is _highly_ recommended to utilize a centralized logging solution to 
simplify the collection, alerting, reporting, storage, and visualization of 
these logs.

</Note>

You can use your log management solution to ingest Consul audit log data to best 
meet your organization's regulatory compliance requirements or organizational policies.

For more information on how to ingest these logs, check the documentation pages 
for your log management solutions such as
[Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/) or [Splunk](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation).
