# Disaster recovery overview

This topic provides an overview of the architectural considerations and recommendations for preparing a disaster recovery strategy for your Consul datacenter.

## Introduction

Disaster recovery considerations are an important part of a company’s overall business continuity planning. Both [Recovery Point Objectives](#glossary) (RPO) and [Recovery Time Objectives](#glossary) (RTO) should be considered.  With Consul, there are several important considerations to keep in mind when planning for disaster recovery. 

<Note>

  Consul snapshots contain extremely sensitive data (e.g. credentials in recoverable form) and therefore should only be stored on an encrypted medium with sufficiently strict access controls in place. 

</Note>

The recommended method of backing up Consul state is to use the built-in Consul [snapshot](/consul/commands/snapshot) command accessed via the API or CLI. This will ensure a consistent and atomic point-in-time capture of the Consul cluster state. The next tutorial, [Backup Consul Data and State](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/backup-and-restore) covers this in more detail. 

For Consul clusters deployed to HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), the recommended method of backing up Consul's state is to use the **snapshots** functionality in the **related cluster section** in the HCP Consul Dedicated UI. Taking snapshots using the Consul agent or using the automated backups feature of Consul Enterprise agents is also possible.

## Backup Storage

- Although block or file-based disk backups (e.g. AWS Volume snapshots, Azure Backup) can be an effective way of backing up other services, they cannot reliably restore a Consul cluster to its original state. 

- Snapshots should be stored on mounted or external storage, instead of local or ephemeral storage.

## Backup Management

- Snapshots should be taken on a regular basis. They can be automated through the use of scripting, 3rd party tools, or the [automated backups](/consul/docs/manage/automated-backup) feature of Consul Enterprise. 

- How frequently snapshots are taken should align with the RTO and RPO set forth within each customer’s disaster recovery policies. 

<Note>

 Consul Enterprise offers the native ability to automatically back up Consul state to cloud storage (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob, etc.), via [automated backups](/consul/docs/manage/automated-backup). 

</Note>

- Retention policies should be configured on mounted or external storage to align with the customer’s data retention and compliance policies. 

## Restore

- Customers should regularly test and validate the restore process for critical systems to ensure that everything works as expected. This is typically defined within a [Disaster Recovery Plan](#glossary) (DRP). 

- In the event of a loss of quorum in the primary Consul cluster or a complete loss of the primary Consul cluster, to restore you will need to build a new Consul cluster from the latest snapshot. Consul client agents may also need to be re-installed/reconfigured. Automation technologies can greatly reduce the amount of time that it will take to perform these steps. Keep this in mind when considering RPO and RTO. 

- When you restore a snapshot to a new Consul cluster, Note the following behavior: 

  - If [token persistence](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file) was enabled on client agents **prior** to performing a snapshot restore, then the client agents will continue to function after the restore.

  - If the ACL token is specified directly in the [client agent configuration](/consul/docs/reference/agent/configuration-file) **prior** to performing a snapshot restore, then the client agents will continue to function after the restore.

  - If neither of the above options were configured **prior** to a snapshot restore, then client agents will not function after the restore as they will not have permissions to register with the new Consul cluster.

    - This would be relevant if the ACL token was set via the API/CLI or if the ACL token was set via an environment variable.

## Region failure

In the event of a total region failure, Consul and your services are likely down. To architect against this situation, deploy Consul and your services in multiple regions with a global failover policy that reroutes network traffic to the alternate region during a disaster. Deploying identical Consul servers and services across multiple cloud regions satisfies datacenter latency requirements and limits the blast radius during large-scale disasters.

## Service failure

To architect against outages caused by disasters that impact services registered with Consul, use [cluster peering failover with sameness groups](/consul/docs/multi-tenant/sameness-group/vm). With this setup, Consul can transparently failover requests to an unhealthy service to the same service in a different region and datacenter.

## Multi-cluster disaster recovery

The [disaster recovery](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/disaster-recovery) considerations for Consul single cluster deployments apply to Consul multi-cluster deployments, however, there a few additional considerations that are specific to Consul multi-cluster deployments. 

When you design and architect your Consul environment, it is important to consider the critical role of the primary datacenter within the multi-cluster deployment. The primary Consul datacenter serves as the ‘source of truth’ for the following data. 

1. Certificate Authority management, if you use the built-in Consul CA. The root CA resides in the primary Consul datacenter and must sign the certificates for the additional Consul datacenters. 
1. ACLs
1. Intentions

Therefore, it is important to consider both placement of the primary Consul datacenter as well as the steps required to recover from a disaster. The recommended approach is reviewed in detail below. 

### Clientless primary Consul datacenter

Once you establish and federate a primary Consul datacenter; you cannot migrate, change, or move it. An effective pattern for large Consul multi-cluster deployments is to have a dedicated primary Consul datacenter with the sole purpose of serving as a primary. You would only include Consul servers in this primary datacenter and not connect any client nodes or services. This primary Consul datacenter can then be federated normally with other Consul datacenters, which will each contain both servers and clients.

This approach provides two distinct advantages.

1. It becomes easier to move the primary Consul datacenter. For example, you may want to migrate it from an on premises datacenter to a cloud environment. Typically, this would entail performing a backup and restore of the primary Consul datacenter to the alternate location. Review the [Disaster Recovery for the Primary Datacenter](/consul/tutorials/datacenter-operations/recovery-outage-primary) tutorial for guidance on restoring a Consul cluster. 
- In the event of a disaster, the additional Consul datacenters can still continue to function independently of the primary Consul datacenter although functionality will be reduced until the primary Consul datacenter is brought back online. See the table below for more details. 

### Primary Consul datacenter outage behaviors

The table below assumes that the primary Consul datacenter is offline. It is implied that when referencing 'any Consul datacenter' that the primary Consul datacenter is not included.  

| Consul Cluster Functionality  | Within local Consul datacenter  | Within any Consul datacenter  | Comments  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read ACLs  | ✔  | ✔  | Assumes that the default setting of ‘extend cache’ is used for the ACL down policy  |
| Create/Update/Delete ACLs  | ✖  | ✖  |   |
| Read Intentions  | ✔  | ✔  | Assumes that Intentions were created when primary datacenter was online  |
| Create/Update/Delete Intentions  | ✖  | ✖  |   |

## Glossary

### Recovery point objective (RPO)

A recovery point objective is defined as the maximum amount of data loss that can be incurred from a disaster, failure, or comparable event. This is measured as a unit of time and there is usually a 1-to-1 correlation between RPO and backup frequency. 

### Recovery time objective (RTO)

A recovery time objective is defined as the amount of time that passes between application failure and full availability which includes how much time it takes to recover from the disaster or failure. This could be relatively short for a customer that already has another datacenter location available for disaster recovery purposes and replication of services and data occurs on a regular basis. Additionally, customers that leverage automation technologies may be able to recover more quickly from a disaster. 

### Disaster recovery plan (DRP)

A formal document created by an organization that contains the processes used to recover access to systems and data after a catastrophic event. DRPs will typically also include a set of processes for testing and validating disaster recovery procedures and establish a regular cadence for these events.
