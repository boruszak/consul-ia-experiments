# Upgrading Consul on RedHat OpenShift

This page describes considerations and strategies for upgrading Consul deployments running on OpenShift clusters. When Consul runs on OpenShift clusters, there are two sides to the deployment - a Helm chart located in Docker Hub, and a Consul container from the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog. In addition to upgrading the container of Consul, you may need to update your Helm chart as well.

## Upgrade types

We recommend updating Consul on RedHat OpenShift when:

  - You change your Helm configuration
  - A new Helm chart is released
  - You want to upgrade your Consul version

The upgrade procedure you use depends on the type of upgrade you are performing.

## Determine scope of changes

Before upgrading, it is important to understand the changes that affect your cluster. For example, you need to take more care if your upgrade results in the Consul server StatefulSet being redeployed.

There is no built-in functionality in Helm that shows what a Helm upgrade changes. There is, however, a Helm plugin [helm-diff](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff) that can be used.

1. Install `helm-diff` with:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
  ```

1. Determine your current installed chart version.

  ```shell-session
  $ helm list --filter consul --namespace consul
  NAME  	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART        	APP VERSION
  consul	consul  	1       	2025-04-22 14:39:13.599498 +0200 CEST	deployed	consul-1.4.0	1.18.0
  ```

  In this example, chart version `1.4.0` is being used along with Consul version `1.18.0`, and is installed in the `consul` namespace.

1. If you are updating your `values.yaml` file, do so now. For example, edit the `global.image` stanza to `image: registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.18.2-ubi`

1. Take the same `helm upgrade` command you were planning to issue but perform `helm diff upgrade` instead of `helm upgrade`:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm diff upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version 1.4.0 --values /path/to/your/values.yaml
  default, consul-server, StatefulSet (apps) has changed:
  # Source: consul/templates/server-statefulset.yaml
  # StatefulSet to run the actual Consul server cluster.
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: StatefulSet
  ...
          containers:
          - name: consul
  -           image: "registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.18.0-ubi"
  +           image: "registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.18.2-ubi"
  ...
  ```

  This command prints out the manifests that will be updated and their diffs.

1. To see only updated objects, add `| grep "has changed"`:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm diff upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version 1.4.0 --values /path/to/your/values.yaml | grep "has changed"
  default, consul-server, StatefulSet (apps) has changed:
  ```

1. Take specific note if `consul-server, StatefulSet` is listed, as it means your Consul server statefulset will be redeployed.

  If your Consul server statefulset needs to be redeployed, follow the same pattern for upgrades as
  on other platforms by redeploying servers one by one. Refer to [Upgrading Consul](/consul/docs/upgrade) for more information.

  If neither the server statefulset is not being redeployed, then you can continue with the Helm upgrade without any specific sequence to follow.


### Helm configuration changes

If you make a change to your Helm values file, you need to perform a `helm upgrade` for those changes to take effect.

1. List the available versions of the chart:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm search repo hashicorp/consul --versions
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.9        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.8        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.7        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.6        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.5        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.4        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.3        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.2        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.1        	1.18.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.0        	1.18.0     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  ...
  ```

1. Assume you want to upgrade to chart version `1.4.9` and Consul version `1.18.2`. You can do this by updating your `values.yaml` file to set the `global.image` value to the desired version:

   <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml" highlight="2">
   ```yaml
   global:
     image: "registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.18.2-ubi"
     ... # other values
   ```
   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Perform a `helm upgrade` and make sure that you specify the correct chart version - in this case `1.4.9`:

   ```shell-session
   $ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version 1.4.9 --values /path/to/my/values.yaml
   ```

~> Note: If you don't pass the `--version` flag when upgrading a Helm chart, Helm uses the most up-to-date version of the chart in its local cache, which may result in an unintended version upgrade.

### Upgrade Helm chart version

You may wish to upgrade your Helm chart version to take advantage of new features and bug fixes, or because you want to upgrade your Consul version and it requires a certain Helm chart version.

1. Update your local Helm repository cache:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm repo update
  ```

1. List all available versions.

  ```shell-session hideClipboard
  $ helm search repo hashicorp/consul --versions
  NAME            	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.6        	1.19.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.5        	1.19.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.4        	1.19.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.3        	1.19.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.1        	1.19.1     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.5.0        	1.19.0     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.9        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  hashicorp/consul	1.4.8        	1.18.2     	Official HashiCorp Consul Chart
  ...
  ```

  1. To determine which version you have installed, issue the following command:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm list --filter consul --namespace consul
  NAME  	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART        	APP VERSION
  consul	default  	4       	2025-04-22 18:06:50.116635 +0200 CEST	deployed	consul-1.4.9	1.18.2
  ```

  In this example, chart version `1.4.9` with Consul binary version `1.18.2` is being used.

1. Check the changelog for any breaking changes from that version and any versions in between: [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-k8s/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Then edit your `values.yaml` file to set the `global.image` value to the desired version. In this example, we are upgrading to chart version `1.5.6` and Consul version `1.19.1`:

   <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml" highlight="2">
   ```yaml
   global:
     image: "registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.19.1-ubi"
   ```
   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Upgrade by performing a `helm upgrade` with the `--version` flag set to the chart version you want to upgrade to:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version "1.5.6" --values /path/to/my/values.yaml
  Release "consul" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!

### Upgrade Consul version

If a new version of Consul is released, you need to perform a Helm upgrade to update to the new version. Before you upgrade to a new version:

1. Read the [Upgrading Consul](/consul/docs/upgrade) documentation.
1. Read any [specific instructions](/consul/docs/upgrade/version-specific) for the version you want to upgrade to, as well as the Consul [changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for that version.
1. Read our [Compatibility Matrix](/consul/docs/deploy/server/k8s/requirements) to ensure your current Helm chart version supports this Consul version. If it does not, you may need to also upgrade your Helm chart version at the same time.
1. Set `global.image` in your `values.yaml` to the desired version:

   <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml" highlight="2">

   ```yaml
   global:
     image: "registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.19.2-ubi"
   ```

   </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Determine the version of your existing Helm installation. The following example shows that chart version `1.5.6` along with Consul version `1.19.1` is installed.

  ```shell-session
  $ helm list --filter consul --namespace consul
  NAME  	NAMESPACE	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART        	APP VERSION
  consul	consul  	6       	2025-04-22 18:24:14.80587 +0200 CEST	deployed	consul-1.5.6	1.19.1
  ```

1. Check the [Consul on Kubernetes Version Compatibility](/consul/docs/upgrade/k8s/compatibility) matrix. Each 1.x version of the chart corresponds to a specific 1.x version of Consul. You may need to upgrade your chart version to match the Consul version you want to upgrade to.

1. Perform a `helm upgrade`:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version 1.5.6 --values /path/to/my/values.yaml
  Release "consul" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!

~> Note: If you don't pass the `--version` flag when upgrading a Helm chart, Helm uses the most up-to-date version of the chart in its local cache, which may result in an unintended version upgrade.

## Rolling upgrade for zero downtime

If you are upgrading a Consul server cluster in K8s, you can perform a rolling upgrade to ensure that your Consul cluster is always available. This is done by setting the `updatePartition` value in your Helm chart configuration.
The `updatePartition` value controls how many instances of the server cluster are updated. Only instances with an index _greater than_ the `updatePartition` value are updated (zero-indexed). Therefore, by setting it equal to replicas, updates should not occur immediately.
The `updatePartition` value is set in the `server` section of your Helm chart configuration. The default value is `0`, which means that all instances of the server cluster will be updated at once.
To perform a rolling upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Change the `global.image` value to the desired Consul version. In this example, we are running version `v1.19.1` and upgrading to `v1.20.0`.
1. Set the `server.updatePartition` value to the number of server replicas. By default, there are 3 servers, so you would set this value to `3`.
1. Set the `updateStrategy` for clients to `OnDelete`.

  <CodeBlockConfig filename="values.yaml">

  ```yaml
  global:
    ...
    image: 'registry.connect.redhat.com/hashicorp/consul:1.20.0-ubi'
    ...
  server:
    replicas: 3
    updatePartition: 3
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

  The `updatePartition` value controls how many instances of the server cluster are updated. Only zero-indexed instances with an index _greater than_ the `updatePartition` value are updated. Therefore, by setting it equal to replicas, updates to the server pods should not occur immediately.

1. Next, perform the initial step of the upgrade:

  ```shell-session
  $ helm upgrade consul hashicorp/consul --namespace consul --version 1.6.0 --values /path/to/your/values.yaml
  ```

  This command does not cause the servers to redeploy, although the resource is updated. If everything is stable, decrease the `updatePartition` value by one and perform `helm upgrade` again. This will cause the first Consul server to be stopped and restarted with the new image.

1. Wait until the Consul server cluster is healthy again (30s to a few minutes).
   This can be confirmed by issuing `consul members` on one of the previous servers, and ensuring that all servers are listed and are `alive`. For example, to run the command on the first server, run `kubectl exec -it -n consul consul-server-0 -- consul members`

1. Decrease `updatePartition` by one and upgrade again. Continue until `updatePartition` is `0`. At this point, you may remove the `updatePartition` configuration. Your server upgrade is complete.

## Upgrading to Consul Dataplane

In earlier versions, Consul on Kubernetes used client agents in its deployments. As of `v1.14.0`, Consul uses [Consul Dataplane](/consul/docs/connect/dataplane/) in Kubernetes deployments instead of client agents.

If you upgrade Consul from a version lower than `v1.14.0` to version `v1.14.0` or higher, complete the following steps to upgrade your deployment safely and without downtime.

1. If ACLs are enabled, you must first upgrade to consul-k8s `0.49.8`. These versions expose the setting `connectInject.prepareDataplanesUpgrade` which is required for no-downtime upgrades when ACLs are enabled.

   Set `connectInject.prepareDataplanesUpgrade` to `true` and then perform the upgrade to `0.49.8`.

  ```yaml filename="values.yaml"
  connectInject:
    prepareDataplanesUpgrade: true
  ```

1. Consul dataplanes disables Consul clients by default, but during an upgrade you need to ensure Consul clients continue to run. Edit your Helm chart configuration and set the [`client.enabled`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/helm#v-client-enabled) field to `true` and specify an action for Consul to take during the upgrade process in the [`client.updateStrategy`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/helm#v-client-updatestrategy) field:

  ```yaml filename="values.yaml"
  client:
    enabled: true
    updateStrategy: |
      type: OnDelete
  ```

1. Follow our [recommended procedures to upgrade servers](#upgrade-consul-version) on Kubernetes deployments to upgrade Helm values for the new version of Consul. The latest version of consul-k8s components may be in a CrashLoopBackoff state during the performance of the server upgrade from versions <1.14.x until all Consul servers are on versions >=1.14.x. Components in CrashLoopBackoff will not negatively affect the cluster because older versioned components will still be operating. Once all servers have been fully upgraded, the latest consul-k8s components will automatically restore from CrashLoopBackoff and older component versions will be spun down.

1. Run `kubectl rollout restart` to restart your service mesh applications. Restarting service mesh application causes Kubernetes to re-inject them with the webhook for dataplanes.

1. Restart all gateways in your service mesh.

1. Now that all services and gateways are using Consul dataplanes, disable client agents in your Helm chart by deleting the `client` stanza or setting `client.enabled` to `false` and running a `consul-k8s` or Helm upgrade.

1. If ACLs are enabled, outdated ACL tokens will persist a result of the upgrade. You can manually delete the tokens to declutter your Consul environment.

   Outdated connect-injector tokens have the following description: `token created via login: {"component":"connect-injector"}`. Do not delete
   the tokens that have a description where `pod` is a key, for example `token created via login: {"component":"connect-injector","pod":"default/consul-connect-injector-576b65747c-9547x"}`). The dataplane-enabled connect inject pods use these tokens.

   You can also review the creation date for the tokens and only delete the injector tokens created before your upgrade, but do not delete all old tokens without considering if they are still in use. Some tokens, such as the server tokens, are still necessary.
