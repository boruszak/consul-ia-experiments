# Load balance with HAProxy

This page describes how to use HAProxy's native integration to automatically
configure the load balancer with service discovery data from Consul. This allows
HAProxy to automatically scale its backend server pools by leveraging its
`server-template` function and Consul's service discovery.

You will set up a basic HAProxy configuration based on a `server-template` that 
generates the load balancer backend server pool configuration based on the 
available service instances registered in Consul service discovery.

## Requirements

To complete this guide, you will need previous experience with Consul and HAProxy. 
Additionally, you should have the following infrastructure configured.

- A Consul datacenter with the web UI enabled.
- At least three Consul client nodes, to register the web services and health checks referenced in this guide. 
- Standard web servers running on each node, listening on `HTTP` port `80`.
- `enable_local_script_checks` must be set to `true` on the client nodes.
- A running instance of HAProxy of version 1.8+ (LTS) HAProxy should also be co-located with a Consul client.
  To get HAProxy visit the [downloads page](http://www.haproxy.org/#down).

When you've completed the steps listed in this guide your infrastructure will look like the diagram below.

## Create the HAProxy configuration

Start with a new install of HAProxy with the default configuration located in `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`. 
Add the following configuration at the end of the defaults.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg">

```plaintext
defaults
   timeout connect 5s
   timeout client 1m
   timeout server 1m

frontend stats
   bind *:1936
   mode http
   stats uri /
   stats show-legends
   no log

frontend http_front
   bind *:80
   default_backend http_back

backend http_back
    balance roundrobin
    server-template mywebapp 1-10 _web._tcp.service.consul resolvers consul    resolve-opts allow-dup-ip resolve-prefer ipv4 check

resolvers consul
    nameserver consul 127.0.0.1:8600
    accepted_payload_size 8192
    hold valid 5s
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Frontend

The `frontend http_front` stanza instructs HAProxy to listen for `HTTP` requests
on `TCP` port `80` and to use the `http_back` server pool as the respective load
balancer backend.

### Backend

In this example, the `backend http_back` stanza includes two main settings,
`balance` type, and `server-template`. The `balance` type is round robin and
will load balance across the available service in order.

The server-template is what allows Consul service registrations to configure
HAProxy's backend server pool. This means you do not need to explicitly add your
backend servers' IP addresses. The configuration specifies a `server-template` 
named `mywebapp`. The template name is not tied to the service name which is
registered in Consul.

The `server-template` will provision `10` slots for backend servers in HAProxy's
runtime configuration. It will reserve the memory for up to `10` instances even 
if you do not use them all. If you have more than `10` healthy and available 
services, HAProxy will use only `10` of them and backfill available slots in 
case of a service error. You can configure the number of available slots.

`_web._tcp.service.consul` will instruct HAProxy to use the DNS SRV record for
the backend service `_web.service.consul_` to discover the available services.

This configuration will also allow running two service instances on the same IP
address using different ports `resolve-opts allow-dup-ip` and will resolve IPv4
addresses for the service endpoints `resolve-prefer ipv4`.

Finally, specify that the server template should look at the `resolvers consul` 
stanza to discover where to find Consul's DNS interface.

You can learn more about the HAProxy server-template feature in [HAProxy's
documentation](https://docs.haproxy.org/2.6/configuration.html#4-server-template).

<Note>

Consul has sophisticated distributed health checks, so the additional HAProxy 
health `check` is not necessarily needed, depending on the configuration of 
Consul's health checks and the update interval HAProxy uses to discover healthy 
endpoints from Consul's service discovery.

</Note>

### Resolvers

The `resolvers consul` stanza defines the actual service discovery endpoint to
be used by HAProxy.

`nameserver consul 127.0.0.1:8600` points HAProxy to the DNS interface of the
local Consul client.

You will need to allow for a larger payload by configuring
`accepted_payload_size 8192`, since DNS SRV records can result in larger DNS
replies from Consul service discovery. This is based on the number of available
and healthy services.

Finally `hold valid 5s` will instruct HAProxy to check Consul's service catalog
every 5 seconds for updates on available and healthy service endpoints. This
value is also tuned in this example for faster service discovery.

For all available configuration options for HAProxy resolvers, please refer to
the configuration
[documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html#5.3.2-resolvers).

### Reload HAProxy

Reload your HAProxy instance to apply the adjusted `haproxy.cfg` configuration
file.

```shell-session
$ service haproxy reload
``` 

### Check HAProxy Statistics Page

A statistics and monitoring page of HAProxy will be accessible at 
`http://<Your-HAProxy-IP-address>:1936` which can be used for basic monitoring purposes.

Navigate to the monitoring page now and you will notice `10` pre-provisioned load
balancer backend slots for your service, but none of them is used yet.

## Register a web service

To register the web service on your first node with Consul, create a service
definition in Consul's configuration directory - `/etc/consul.d/`.

<CodeTabs>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.hcl">

```hcl
service {
  name = "web"
  port = 80
  check {
    args = ["curl", "localhost"]
    interval = "3s"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.json">

```json
{
  "service": {
    "Name": "web",
    "Port": 80,
    "check": {
      "args": ["curl", "localhost"],
      "interval": "3s"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</CodeTabs>

Reload the client to read the new service definition.

```shell-session
$ consul reload
```

Register a second web service by repeating this process on a second node. 

### Verify services are registered in Consul

If the registration was successful you should see the change reflects in Consul 
catalog. Choose your preferred method to verify the services are registered 
correctly in Consul.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Use the `consul catalog` command to check available services.

```shell-session
$ consul catalog services
consul
web
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API" group="api">

Use the `/v1/catalog/services` API endpoint to to check available services.

```shell-session
$ curl --silent http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/catalog/services | jq
```

You should get the following output, showing both the `consul` service, 
representing the Consul server agents, and the `web` service you just registered.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```json
{
  "consul": [],
  "web": []
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Use the `/v1/catalog/service/web` API endpoint to get more details on the `web`
service's instances.

```shell-session
$ curl --silent http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/catalog/service/web | jq
```

You should get an output similar to the following.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="DNS" group="dns">

Query the Consul DNS service for instances of the `web` service.

```shell-session
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 -t srv web.service.consul +short
1 1 80 web-app-1.node.dc1.consul.
1 1 80 web-app-0.node.dc1.consul.
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Check load balancing

The services are also reflects on the HAProxy monitoring UI where you can verify 
that two instances of the `10` available are now up and running.

![HAProxy monitoring UI with two service instances.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-two_instances.png#light-theme-only)
![HAProxy monitoring UI with two service instances.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-two_instances-dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Browse to the IP address of your HAProxy load balancer and reload the page
several times. Because you registered two services in Consul and configured
HAProxy to use round robin load balancing, you should see the connection
toggling between both your available web servers.

## Scale your backend servers

HAProxy will query against Consul's DNS interface every `5` seconds to check if
something changed within the requested service `web`.

Scale your web service registering the instance running on your third node.

Create a service definition in the third Consul client's configuration directory
(`/etc/consul.d/`).

<CodeTabs>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.hcl">

```hcl
service {
  name = "web"
  port = 80
  check {
    args = ["curl", "localhost"]
    interval = "3s"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.json">

```json
{
  "service": {
    "Name": "web",
    "Port": 80,
    "check": {
      "args": ["curl", "localhost"],
      "interval": "3s"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</CodeTabs>

Reload the client to read the new service definition.

```shell-session
$ consul reload
```

<Note>

In production deployments you should automate the registration of new instances 
of a service, so that Consul will know when new services in the datacenter start.

</Note>

Once you register the new web service, HAProxy will detect the change and 
trigger an update in its runtime configuration. After scaling your backend
server from two to three instances, the resulting runtime load balancer
configuration for your HAProxy instance will be reflected in the statistics page.

![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances.png#light-theme-only)
![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances-dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Traffic should now be load balanced across all three available services.

### Stop one backend service

HAProxy's service discovery integration will scale your backend configuration 
automatically (up and down) depending on available services and it will only use 
healthy services for rendering the final configuration.

You configured Consul to perform a basic `curl` based health check in your
service definition, Consul will notice if the `web` server instance is in an
unhealthy state.

To simulate an error and see how Consul health checks are working, stop the web
server process on one of you backend servers.

```shell-session
$ service <WEBSERVER> stop
```

You will see the state of this service instance as "Unhealthy" in the Consul UI
immediately as the simple `curl` health check will result in an error as no
service responds to requests on `HTTP` port `80`.

![Consul UI service web page showing three instances, one unhealthy.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/consul-ui-service-web-three_instances_one_failing.png#light-theme-only)
![Consul UI service web page showing three instances, one unhealthy.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/consul-ui-service-web-three_instances_one_failing-dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Due to its regular check against Consul's DNS interface, your HAProxy instance
will notice that a change in the health of one of the services has occurred and
will adjust its runtime load balancer configuration.

Your HAProxy instance will now only balance traffic between the remaining
healthy services.

You can again check the resulting runtime load balancer configuration for your
HAProxy instance in the statistics page.

![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances one unhealthy.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances_one_failed.png#light-theme-only)
![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances one unhealthy.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances_one_failed-dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Note, that the unhealthy instance is not in an error state from HAProxy's
perspective. It is in maintenance state (`MAINT`) as DNS resolution for this
specific host is not working anymore.

<Note>

Consul health checks can look at CPU utilization, RAM usage, and other metrics 
of your web services that central load balancer can't monitor. Learn more about 
Consul's health check feature in the 
[health check tutorial](/consul/tutorials/connect-services/monitor-applications-health-checks).

</Note>

Restart the stopped `web` server instance. The Consul health check will mark the
service as "Healthy" and it will be added back into the load balancer backend
configuration to serve traffic.

## Add DNS weights to the HAProxy configuration

In addition to Consul's DNS interface for querying only healthy instances,
HAProxy's service discovery integration can also evaluate the DNS weight. In
this section, you will adjust one of your services to give it a higher weight.
This will enable HAProxy to adjust its runtime value for the backend server
weight, which will result in sending more traffic to the respective backend
server.

This approach can be helpful if your servers are different sizes, or some
instances of a service are able to handle more requests than others.

### Check the current weight

First, check the assigned DNS weights in Consul using the Consul DNS interface.

```shell-session
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 -t srv web.service.consul +short
1 1 80 web-app-0.node.dc1.consul.
1 1 80 web-app-1.node.dc1.consul.
1 1 80 web-app-2.node.dc1.consul.
```

The DNS weight is the column before the port number (which is `80`). The DNS
weight is currently set to `1` for all of your healthy services, which is the
default that Consul uses.

### Add a weight to one service

[HAProxy](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.8/configuration.html#weight)
supports weights between 1 and 256. Consul's officially supported DNS weights
don't match the supported HAProxy backend server weights, so you need to convert
the desired HAProxy weight to a DNS weight configured in Consul's service
definition with the following formula.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
([Desired weight in HAProxy] * 256) - 1 = (Service weight in Consul)
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

In our example we want to have a HAProxy weight of 2 which results in the
following calculation:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
(2 * 256) - 1 = 511
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Adjust one of your service definitions by adding the `weights` option to the
`web` service registration.

<CodeTabs>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.hcl" highlight="8-11">

```hcl
service {
  name = "web"
  port = 80
  check {
    args = ["curl", "localhost"]
    interval = "3s"
  }
  weights {
    passing = 511
    warning = 1
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

<CodeBlockConfig filename="web-service.json" highlight="9-12">

```json
{
  "service": {
    "Name": "web",
    "Port": 80,
    "check": {
      "args": ["curl", "localhost"],
      "interval": "3s"
    },
    "weights": {
      "passing": 511,
      "warning": 1
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</CodeTabs>

Reload the local Consul client to read the new service definition.

```shell-session
$ consul reload
```

### Check the new weight

First, check Consul's DNS interface to make sure Consul now shows another weight
for the service instance you just configured.

```shell-session
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 -t srv web.service.consul +short
1 511 80 web-app-1.node.dc1.consul.
1 1 80 web-app-0.node.dc1.consul.
1 1 80 web-app-2.node.dc1.consul.
```

Second, you can check the HAProxy statistics page, `http://<Your-HAProxy-IP-address>:1936`.

![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances one with different weight.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances_weight.png#light-theme-only)
![HAProxy monitoring UI with three service instances one with different weight.](/img/discover/load-balancer/haproxy/haproxy-ui-three_instances_weight-dark.png#dark-theme-only)

Finally, check that traffic is now being load balanced unequally across the
three available service endpoints. Browse to the IP address of your HAProxy load
balancer and reload the page several times. One of your instances will serve
twice as many requests as the others.

## Next steps

HAProxy's service discovery integration queries Consul's DNS interface on a
regular, configurable basis to get updates about changes for a given service and
adjusts the runtime configuration of HAProxy automatically. You can adjust your
HAProxy runtime configuration by configuring additional options in Consul like
DNS weights.

In this tutorial you configured HAProxy to natively integrate with Consul for
service discovery. You also tested the HAProxy runtime configuration based on
service healthy service and weight. Finally, you were able to monitor the
changes with the Consul UI, HAProxy UI, and Consul DNS interface.
