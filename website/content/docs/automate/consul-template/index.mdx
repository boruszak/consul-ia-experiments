# Consul Template

This topic provides an overview of the Consul Template tool, which enables a programmatic method for rendering configuration files from a variety of locations, including the Consul KV store. It is an effective workflow option for replacing complicated API queries that often require custom formatting.

For more information about the KV store and using it to automatically configure application deployments, refer to [dynamically configure applications](/consul/docs/dynamic-app/consul-template).

## Introduction

The Consul template tool is not part of the Consul binary. It has a [dedicated GitHub repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) and you must [install `consul-template`](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template#installation) before running it on the command line. Consul templates are based on Go templates and shares many of the same attributes. When initiated, the rool reads one or more template files and queries Consul for all data needed to render them.

In a typical scenario, you run `consul-template` as a daemon that fetches the initial values and then continues to watch for updates. The template re-renders whenever there are relevant changes in the datacenter. The template can also run arbitrary commands after the update process completes. For example, it can send the HUP signal to the load balancer service after a configuration change has been made.

The Consul template tool is flexible, it can fit into many different environments and workflows. Depending on the use case, you may have a single `consul-template` instance on a handful of hosts, or you may need to run several instances on every host. Each `consul-template` process can manage multiple unrelated files and removes duplicated information as needed when files share data dependencies.

The template tool is based on Go templates and shares many of the same attributes.

Consul template is a useful tool with several applications. This tutorial will 
focus on two of its use cases.

1. _Update configuration files_. The Consul template tool can be used
   to update service configuration files. A common use case is managing load
   balancer configuration files that need to be updated regularly in a dynamic
   infrastructure.

1. _Discover data about the Consul datacenter and service_. It is possible to collect
   information about the services in your Consul datacenter. For example, you could
   collect a list of all services running on the datacenter or you could discover all
   service addresses for the Redis service. Note, this use case has limited
   scope for production.

In this tutorial, you will get an introduction on how `consul-template` works,
how to install it, and two use cases.

Before completing this tutorial, you should have some familiarity with
[Consul KV](/consul/tutorials/interactive/get-started-key-value-store)
and [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

## Introduction to Consul template

Consul template is a simple, yet powerful tool. When initiated, it reads one or 
more template files and queries Consul for all data needed to render them. 
Typically, you run `consul-template` as a daemon which will fetch the initial 
values and then continue to watch for updates, re-rendering the template 
whenever there are relevant changes in the datacenter. You can alternatively use 
the `-once` flag to fetch and render the template once which is useful for 
testing and setup scripts that are triggered by some other automation for 
example a provisioning tool. Finally, the template can also run arbitrary 
commands after the update process completes. For example, it can send the HUP 
signal to the load balancer service after a configuration change has been made.

The Consul template tool is flexible, it can fit into many different 
environments and workflows. Depending on the use-case, you may have a single 
`consul-template` instance on a handful of hosts or may need to run several 
instances on every host. Each `consul-template` process can manage multiple 
unrelated files though and will de-duplicate the fetches as needed if those 
files share data dependencies so it can reduce the load on Consul servers to 
share where possible.

## Install Consul template

For this tutorial, you will use a local Consul agent in development mode which 
can be started with `consul agent -dev`. To quickly set up a local Consul agent, 
refer to the getting started [tutorial](/consul/tutorials/get-started-vms/virtual-machine-gs-deploy). 
The Consul agent must be running to complete all of the following steps.

The Consul template tool is not included with the Consul binary and will need to 
be installed separately. It can be installed from a precompiled binary or 
compiled from source. You will be installing the precompiled binary.

First, download the binary from the 
[Consul Template releases page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/).

```shell-session
$ curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/0.19.5/consul-template<_version_OS>.tgz
```

Next, extract the binary and move it into your `$PATH`.

```shell-session
$ tar -zxf consul-template<_version_OS>.tgz
```

To compile from source, check the instructions in the
[contributing section in GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template#contributing).

## Use case: Consul KV

In this first use case example, you will render a template that pulls the 
HashiCorp address from Consul KV. To do this, you will create a simple template 
that contains the HashiCorp address, run `consul-template`, add a value to 
Consul KV for HashiCorp's address, and finally view the rendered file.

First, you will need to create a template file `find_address.tpl` to query
Consul's KV store:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="find_address.tpl">

```go
{{ key "/hashicorp/street_address" }}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Next, you will run `consul-template` specifying both the template to use and the 
file to update.

```shell-session
$ consul-template -template "find_address.tpl:hashicorp_address.txt"
```

The `consul-template` process will continue to run until you kill it with 
`CTRL+c`. For now, you will leave it running.

Finally, open a new terminal so you can write data to the key in Consul using 
the command line interface.

```shell-session
$ consul kv put hashicorp/street_address "101 2nd St"

Success! Data written to: hashicorp/street_address
```

You can verify the data was written by viewing the `hashicorp_address.txt` file 
which will be located in the same directory where `consul-template` was run.

```shell-session
$ cat hashicorp_address.txt

101 2nd St
```

If you update the key `hashicorp/street_address`, you can see the changes to the 
file immediately. Go ahead and try `consul kv put hashicorp/street_address "22b Baker ST"`.

You can verify that this simple process can have powerful implications. For 
example, it is possible to use this same process for updating your 
[HAProxy load balancer configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/blob/master/examples/haproxy.md).

You can now kill the `consul-template` process with `CTRL+c`.

## Use case: discover all services

In this use case example, you will discover all the services running in the 
Consul datacenter. To follow along, you use the local development agent from the 
previous example.

First, you will need to create a new template `all-services.tpl` to query all 
services.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="all-services.tpl">

```go
{{ range services -}}
# {{ .Name }}
{{- range service .Name }}
{{ .Address }}
{{- end }}

{{ end -}}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Next, run Consul template specifying the template you just created and the 
`-once` flag. The `-once` flag will tell the process to run once and then quit.

```shell-session
$ consul-template -template="all-services.tpl:all-services.txt" -once
```

If you complete this on your local development agent, you should still get the 
`consul` service among the results when viewing `all-services.txt`.

```plaintext hideClipboard
# consul
127.0.0.7
```

On a development or production datacenter, you would get a list of all the services.
For example:

```plaintext hideClipboard
# consul
104.131.121.232

# redis
104.131.86.92
104.131.109.224
104.131.59.59

# web
104.131.86.92
104.131.109.224
104.131.59.59
```
