# Configure Consul Template

You configure Consul Template via a configuration file written in the [HashiCorp Configuration Language][hcl]. The configuration is also JSON compatible.
The full list of all options for Consul Template configuration is available in the [configuration reference](/consul/docs/reference/consul-template/configuration).

With the configuration file available you run Consul template with the `-config` flag pointing at the configuration file:

```shell-session
$ consul-template -config "/my/config.hcl"
```

This argument may be specified multiple times to load multiple configuration files. The right-most configuration takes the highest precedence. If the path to a directory is provided (as opposed to the path to a file), all of the files in the given directory will be merged in [lexical order](http://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk), recursively. Please note that symbolic links are _not_ followed.

The full list of available CLI options for Consul Template is available in the [CLI reference](/consul/docs/reference/consul-template/cli).

~> **Note** Commands specified on the CLI take precedence over a config file!

Not all available fields for the configuration file are required. If you are not retrieving secrets from Vault, you do not need to specify a Vault configuration section. Similarly, if you are not logging to syslog, you do not need to specify a syslog configuration.

For additional security, tokens may also be read from the environment using the `CONSUL_TOKEN` or `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables respectively. It is highly recommended that you do not put your tokens in plain-text in a configuration file.

## Example

The example HCL configuration file below connects Consul Template to a Consul agent and renders a template with a value from [Consul KV][consul-kv]. The output is written to a file on disk.

```hcl
consul {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"

  auth {
    enabled = true
    username = "test"
    password = "test"
  }
}

log_level = "warn"

template {
  contents = "{{key \"hello\"}}"
  destination = "out.txt"
  exec {
    command = "cat out.txt"
  }
}
```
