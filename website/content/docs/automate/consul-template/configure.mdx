# Configure Consul Templatee

Configuration files are written in the [HashiCorp Configuration Language][hcl].
By proxy, this means the configuration is also JSON compatible.

Instruct Consul Template to use a configuration file with the `-config` flag:

```shell
$ consul-template -config "/my/config.hcl"
```

This argument may be specified multiple times to load multiple configuration
files. The right-most configuration takes the highest precedence. If the path to
a directory is provided (as opposed to the path to a file), all of the files in
the given directory will be merged in
[lexical order](http://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Walk), recursively. Please
note that symbolic links are _not_ followed.

**Commands specified on the CLI take precedence over a config file!**

Note that not all fields listed below are required. If you are not retrieving
secrets from Vault, you do not need to specify a Vault configuration section.
Similarly, if you are not logging to syslog, you do not need to specify a
syslog configuration.

For additional security, tokens may also be read from the environment using the
`CONSUL_TOKEN` or `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables respectively. It is highly
recommended that you do not put your tokens in plain-text in a configuration
file.

## Example

The example HCL configuration file below connects Consul Template to a Consul
agent and renders a template with a value from [Consul KV][consul-kv]. The
output is written to a file on disk.

```hcl
consul {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8500"

  auth {
    enabled = true
    username = "test"
    password = "test"
  }
}

log_level = "warn"

template {
  contents = "{{key \"hello\"}}"
  destination = "out.txt"
  exec {
    command = "cat out.txt"
  }
}
```
