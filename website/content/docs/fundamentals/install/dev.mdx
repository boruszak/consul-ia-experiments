# Run Consul in dev mode

This page describes the process to run Consul in dev mode to test basic configurations and features.

Do not use dev mode in production environments.

## Overview

When you add the `-dev` flag when starting a Consul agent, it runs a datacenter with a bootstrapped ACL system, allowing you to modify configurations and test Consul features without standing up a production-grade datacenter.
