## Additional tool binaries

We make several additional Consul CLI tools available as separate binary releases. These tools can simplify operations and processes for certain runtimes, cloud providers, or complex network requirements.

The following is a list of Consul tools that we have released as separate packages that are actively supported:

| `consul-terraform-sync`     | Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS)              |

The following is a list of Consul tools that were used by previous versions of Consul. Some tools may be useful when performing Consul updates with especially large release gaps, while others were deprecated entirely.

- `consul-api-gateway`. This feature was fully integrated into the `consul` package in v1.16.
- `consul-telemetry-collector`. This tool was developed to support [HCP Consul Central](/hcp/docs/consul/concepts/consul-central).

## Next steps

To continue learning about Consul and its fundamental operations, [download and install Consul](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install). Then [run a Consul agent in developer mode](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install/dev) so you can learn how to use the 3 main Consul interface: [Consul HTTP API](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/api), [Consul CLI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/cli), and [Consul web UI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/ui).
