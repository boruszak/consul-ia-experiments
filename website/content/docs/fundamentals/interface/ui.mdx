# Consul UI

This page provides an overview of the Consul UI, one of the major user interfaces with Consul clusters alongside the [Consul CLI](consul/commands) and [HTTP API](consul/api-docs).

## Overview

Consul's UI allows you to view and interact with Consul via a graphical user
interface, which can lower the barrier of entry for new users, and ease
troubleshooting.

The Consul UI enables you to view all information about your Consul datacenter, including:

- [Registered nodes](#nodes), both Consul servers and clients.
- [Registered services](#services) and their sidecar proxies.
- Registered gateways, including API, terminating, ingress, and mesh gateways.

Additionally, you can view and update the following information through the Consul UI:

- [Key-value store](#key-value-store)
- [Access Control List (ACL) tokens](#acl-tokens)
- [Service mesh intentions](#intentions)

## Navigate to the UI

If you have a [local development agent](/consul/tutorials/certification-associate-tutorials/get-started-agent), started with `consul agent -dev`, you can open a browser
window and navigate to the UI, which is available at the `/ui` path on the same
port as the HTTP API (port `8500`).

[http://localhost:8500/ui](http://localhost:8500/ui)

If you were running Consul in production you would need to enable the UI in
Consul's configuration file or using the `-ui` command line flag, but because
your agent is running in development mode, the UI is automatically enabled.

## Nodes

Click on the "Nodes" option in the top navigation bar to go to the
nodes page. There you'll find an overview of the entire datacenter including the
health status of each node, IPAddress, number of registered services, and a leader badge
indicating which node is hosting the leading Consul server.

You can select individual nodes to learn about their
health checks, registered services, round trip time, lock sessions, and metadata.

You can also filter the nodes by heath status, or search for them in the search
bar.

## Services

The landing page for the Consul UI is the services page, which gives you a list of all
registered services and gateways including their health, tags, type, and source. You can filter the services visible on the page based on their name, tag,
status, or other search terms.

Click on a specific service to learn more about its instance count, the health
of individual instances, and which agent each instance is registered with.

## Key-value store

In the top navigation, select "Key/Value" to view the page for Consul KV.

The Key/Value page has a folder-like structure. Objects appear nested according to
their key prefix. For example, you could have a folder for each application,
business function, or a nested combination of the two.

## ACL tokens

Consul uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to secure access to the UI, API, CLI, service
communications, and agent communications. You need to [configure
ACLs](/consul/tutorials/security/access-control-setup-production) in your Consul datacenter to
secure it for production. However, on a local development agent started with `consul agent -dev`,
they aren't enabled, so there would be no data on your "ACL" page.

You can secure the UI itself with ACLs, by limiting read, write, and update
permissions for the various pages in the UI. You do this by creating a token
with the appropriate privileges and adding it to the UI under the ACL
page.

To remove access, simply select "Stop using" from your tokens action menu in the
token list.

The browser can store tokens that you add to the UI.

## Intentions

Select the "Intentions" option in the top navigation menu to view service ntention data for Consul
service mesh. To create new intentions, click on the "Create" button at the top right of the
page.

The new intention page allows you to specify the source and destination services, configure service
communication, and add a description. Notice that you have three options for service
communication; Allow, Deny, and Application Aware. The Application Aware option enables you
to more granularly allow or deny communication between services based on path, header, or method.

## Adjust UI settings

In the top-right of any page, select **Settings**.

You can select whether or not you would like to set up a blocking query to
update the UI in real time, rather than upon refresh. This is on by default,
but may need to be disabled for large datacenters due to performance concerns.
