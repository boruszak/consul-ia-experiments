# Environment variables for Consul

This page describes important environment variables that are commonly used during routine Consul operations.

## Introduction

Consul's CLI reads environment variables to define behavior defaults. Although CLI flags take precedence when used, environment variables can simplify interaction and configuration workflows.

The Consul documentation and tutorials usually assume the following environment variables are already configured or include commands to configure them for you.

- The HTTP address of the local Consul agent for interactions, set to `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`
- An ACL token with sufficient permissions for the operation, set to `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` or `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE`

When these environment variables are not set, you must include a combination of the `-http-addr` flag and the `-token` or `-token-file` flag with each command you run. We recommend setting these environment variables at the start of every Consul interaction.

Consul supports additional environment variables that you can use to automate infrastructure configuration. For a full list of environmental variables, refer to the [Consul CLI documentation](/consul/commands).

## `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR`

Set this variable to the HTTP or HTTPS address of the local Consul agent. This address is specified as a URI with an optional scheme.

```plaintext
CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8500
```

or as a Unix socket path:

```plaintext
CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=unix:///var/run/consul_http.sock
```

## `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN`

Set this variable to the value of an ACL token. If the ACL system is not enabled, you do not need to set this variable.

```plaintext
CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=aba7cbe5-879b-999a-07cc-2efd9ac0ffe
```

## `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE`

Set this variable to the path to a file that contains an ACL token. If the ACL system is not enabled, you do not need to set this variable.

```plaintext
CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN_FILE=/path/to/consul.token
```
