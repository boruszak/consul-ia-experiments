# Explore the Consul web UI

This page provides an overview of the Consul web UI, which is one of the ways to interface with a Consul cluster alongside the [Consul CLI](/consul/commands) and [HTTP API](/consul/api-docs).

## Introduction

The web UI allows you to interact with Consul via a graphical user
interface and view information about your Consul datacenter, including:

- [Registered server and client nodes](#nodes)
- [Registered services and sidecar proxies](#services)
- Registered API, terminating, ingress, and mesh gateways

Additionally, you can view and update the following components through the Consul UI:

- [Key-value store](#key-value-store)
- [Access Control List (ACL) tokens](#acl-tokens)
- [Service mesh intentions](#intentions)

### UI task table

@include 'tables/permissions/ui.mdx'

## Navigate to the UI

A local development agent started with `consul agent -dev` automatically enables the web UI. It is available at the `/ui` path on port `8500`, which is the same port as the HTTP API.

Open [`http://localhost:8500/ui`](http://localhost:8500/ui) in your web browser to visit the Consul web UI.

### Enable the UI for non-development agents

Agents that are run without the `-dev` flag must explicitly enable the web UI.

To enable the web UI, you can: 

- Modify the agent start-up command to include the [`-ui` flag](/consul/docs/reference-cli/agent#ui-options).
- Modify the agent configuration file to include the [`ui_config.enabled` attribute](/consul/docs/reference/agent#ui_config_enabled) and set it to `true`.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Modify the agent start-up command" group="agent-command">

```shell-session
$ consul agent -ui [...]
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Modify the agent configuration file" group="agent-config-file">

<CodeBlockConfig filename="agent-config.hcl" highlight="6-8">

```hcl
datacenter = "dc1"
data_dir   = "/opt/consul"

server     = true

ui_config {
  enabled = true
}

# ...
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Using the server address of your Consul server node, open the address in your web browser on port `8500` at the `/ui` path. For example, if the server address is `212.44.23.212`, then open `http://212.44.23.212:8500/ui` in your web browser.

## Services

The initial Consul UI landing page is the Services page, which gives you a list of all
registered services and gateways including their health, tags, type, and source. The Services page is also accessible by clicking on the **Services** option from the left navigation bar.

You can filter services by health status and service type or search for services with the search bar.

Click on a service to see more information about its instance count, the health
of individual instances, and which agent each instance is registered with.

## Nodes

Click on the **Nodes** option in the left navigation bar to go to the Nodes page.

This page shows an overview of the datacenter with information about each node including the health status, the network address, the number of registered services on the node, and a badge beside the node which is currently hosting the cluster leader.

Click on a node to see more information about service health checks, instances, round trip time, lock sessions, and metadata.

You can filter nodes by health status or search for nodes with the search bar.

## Key-value store

Click the **Key/Value** option from the left navigation bar to go to the Key/Value page.

This page has a folder-like structure and nests objects according to
their key prefix.

Objects can be organized with prefixes including by application, business function, or a combination of the two.

## Intentions

Intentions are mechanisms in Consul that control communication between services. Refer to the [Intentions](/consul/docs/secure-mesh/intention) page for more information on Intentions and how to use them.

Click the **Intentions** option from the left navigation bar to go to the Intentions page. Here you can create new intentions specifying the source and destination service, a description, and whether to allow or deny traffic between the two services. Additionally you can set the Intention to be **Application Aware** which allows you to more granularly allow or deny communication between services based on Layer 7 criteria such as path, header, or method.

## Access Control Lists

Consul uses [Access Control Lists](/consul/docs/secure/acl), or ACLs, to secure access to the web UI, API, CLI, service
communications, and agent communications. An operator configures [ACLs](/consul/tutorials/security/access-control-setup-production) in a Consul datacenter to secure it for production.

ACLs are not enabled for local development agents so there will be a red dot beside the **Access Controls** heading in the left navigation bar if Consul is running as a local development agent.

You enable ACLs in the agent configuration file with `enabled` attribute in the `acl` block. Refer to the [Bootstrap ACL system page](/consul/docs/secure/acl/bootstrap) for more information on configuring ACLs.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="agent-config.hcl" highlight="10-12">

```hcl
datacenter = "dc1"
data_dir   = "/opt/consul"

server     = true

ui_config {
  enabled = true
}

acl {
  enabled = true
}

# ...

```

</CodeBlockConfig>

With ACLs enabled and proper permissions set, you can click on the ACL-related pages under the **Access Controls** heading in the left navigation bar and view the **Tokens**, **Policies**, **Roles**, and **Auth Methods** pages. Refer to the the [ACL Tokens](/consul/docs/secure/acl/token), [ACL Policies](/consul/docs/secure/acl/policy), [Roles](/consul/docs/secure/acl/role), and [Auth Methods](/consul/docs/secure/acl/auth-method) documentation pages for more information.

## Adjust UI settings

Click on the **Settings** option from the top navigation bar.

You can select whether or not to enable **Blocking Queries**. This allows the UI to update in real time without manually having to refresh the page. This setting is enabled by default but you may want to disable it on large datacenters for better performance.
