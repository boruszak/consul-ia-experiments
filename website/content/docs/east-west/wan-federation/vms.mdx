# Federate Consul datacenters on VMs

This topic covers the basic form of federating Consul datacenters using a single WAN gossip pool, interconnecting all Consul servers.

Consul Enterprise version 0.8.0 added support for an advanced multiple datacenter capability. Check the [Federate Multiple Datacenters with Network Areas tutorial](/consul/docs/east-west/network-area) for more details.

### WAN gossip pool

One of the key features of Consul is its support for multiple datacenters. The architecture of Consul is designed to promote a low coupling of datacenters so that connectivity issues or failure of any datacenter does not impact the availability of Consul in other datacenters. This means each datacenter runs independently, each having a dedicated group of servers and a private LAN gossip pool.

### Network requirements

There are a few networking requirements that must be satisfied for WAN federation to work. 

- All server nodes must be able to talk to each other. Otherwise, the gossip protocol as well as RPC forwarding will not work. 
- If service discovery is to be used across datacenters, the network must be able to route traffic between IP addresses across regions as well. 

Usually, this means that all datacenters must be connected using a VPN or other tunneling mechanism. Consul does not handle VPN or NAT traversal for you. For RPC forwarding to work, the bind address must be accessible from remote nodes. 

## Setup two datacenters

To get started, follow the [Deployment guide](/consul/tutorials/production-deploy/deployment-guide) to start each datacenter. If ACLs are enabled or you are using Consul Enterprise, you must set the [`primary_datacenter`](/consul/docs/reference/agent#primary_datacenter) in the server's configuration in both datacenters.

After bootstrapping you should have two datacenters, `dc1` and `dc2`. Note that datacenter names are opaque to Consul; they are simply labels that help human operators reason about the Consul datacenters.

To query the known WAN nodes, use the `members` command with the `-wan` parameter on either datacenter.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Datacenter 1" group="dc1">

```shell-session
$ consul members -wan
Node                 Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server-0.dc1  172.18.0.5:8302  alive   server  1.20.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Datacenter 2" group="dc2">

```shell-session
$ consul members -wan
Node                 Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server-1.dc2  172.18.0.7:8302  alive   server  1.20.2  2         dc2  default    <all>
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

The command provides a list of all known members in the WAN gossip pool. In this case, the servers are not yet connected so each datacenter is only aware of local servers.

<Tip> 

The `consul members -wan` command only contains server nodes. Client nodes send requests to a datacenter-local server, so they do not participate in WAN gossip. Client requests are forwarded by local servers to a server in the target datacenter as necessary.

</Tip>

## Join the servers manually

To federate two datacenters, use the `join` command.

```shell-session
$ consul join -wan <server 1> <server 2> ...
```

The `join` command is used with the `-wan` flag to indicate you are attempting to join a server in the WAN gossip pool. As with LAN gossip, you only need to join a single existing member, and the gossip protocol will be used to exchange information about all known members.

### Example

In this example we have two server nodes, `consul-server-0` in `dc1` and `consul-server-1` in `dc2`. The command is running from the first server.

```shell-session
$ consul join -wan consul-server-1
Successfully joined cluster by contacting 1 nodes.
```

During the joining procedure the following lines are recorded on each server logs.

## Join the servers at startup

In production environment it is suggested to setup WAN federation in Consul's configuration files. In this way the configuration is applied immediately at startup and it is persisted across reboots. Consul provides the [`retry_join_wan`](/consul/docs/reference/agent#retry_join_wan) parameter to configure the addresses of the other servers to WAN join at startup.

<CodeTabs>

```hcl
retry_join_wan = ["dc2-server-1", "dc2-server-2"]
```

```json
{
  "retry_join_wan": ["dc2-server-1", "dc2-server-2"]
}
```

</CodeTabs>

## Verify datacenter configuration

Once the join is complete the servers from both datacenters will be shown in the WAN gossip pool.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Use the `members` command to verify that all server nodes gossiping over WAN.

```shell-session
$ consul members -wan
Node                 Address          Status  Type    Build   Protocol  DC   Partition  Segment
consul-server-0.dc1  172.18.0.5:8302  alive   server  1.20.2  2         dc1  default    <all>
consul-server-1.dc2  172.18.0.7:8302  alive   server  1.20.2  2         dc2  default    <all>
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="API" group="api">

Use the [HTTP Catalog API](/consul/api-docs/catalog#list-datacenters) to get a list of all known datacenters.

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/datacenters
```

In this example the two datacenters known to Consul are `dc1` and `dc2`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```json
[
  "dc2",
  "dc1"
]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can use the `dc` selector to retrieve information for servers in other datacenters.

```shell-session
$ curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/nodes?dc=dc2
```

This will return all the known nodes in the `dc2` datacenter.

## Troubleshooting WAN federation

Configuring `serf_wan`, `advertise_addr_wan` and `translate_wan_addrs` can lead to a situation where `consul members -wan` lists remote nodes but RPC 
operations fail with one of the following errors:

- `No path to datacenter`
- `rpc error getting client: failed to get conn: dial tcp <LOCAL_ADDR>:0-><REMOTE_ADDR>:<REMOTE_RPC_PORT>: i/o timeout`

The most likely cause of these errors is that `bind_addr` is set to a private address preventing the RPC server from accepting connections across the WAN. Setting `bind_addr` to a public address (or one that can be routed across the WAN) will resolve this issue. Be aware that exposing the RPC server on a public port should only be done **after** firewall rules have been established.

The [`translate_wan_addrs`](/consul/docs/reference/agent#translate_wan_addrs) configuration provides a basic address rewriting capability.

## Data replication

In general, data is not replicated between different Consul datacenters. When a request is made for a resource in another datacenter, the local Consul servers forward an RPC request to the remote Consul servers for that resource and return the results. If the remote datacenter is not available, then those resources will also not be available, but that won't otherwise affect the local datacenter. 
There are some special situations where a limited subset of data can be replicated, such as with Consul's built-in ACL replication capability, or
external tools like [consul-replicate](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-replicate/).
